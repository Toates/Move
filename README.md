...is a simple Windows taskbar based application aimed at prompting the user to take regular breaks.

The user can set an interval that will then countdown and when it has expired triggers a number of actions to alert the user including:

 - flashing the screen
 - making noises
 - displaying tooltips
 - or even locking the machine
 
All actions are optional and configurable in many ways.
